# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 12, Part-1,
This was a very interesting lab because I was always curious on how gifs work, and now that we were able to code our own gif it showed what goes behind the scenes of these beautiful images that we see everyday. 

Lab 3, Part-1, 
I loved this lab because we were able to calculate BMR. Writing functions to calculate famous peoples body mass amazed me and being able to see the outcome amazed the work I completed. 

Lab 4, Part-2,
This lab was really fun because we made a HI-LO game in which we were able to create secret numbers and create winning outputs. When the correct numbers were placed and the winning output showed it was amazing because I always wanted to make a game. =
